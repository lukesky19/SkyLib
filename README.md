## FAQ
Q: What versions does this plugin support?

A: 1.21.4, 1.21.5, 1.21.6, 1.21.7, and 1.21.8.

Q: Are there any plans to support any other versions?

A: I will always do my best to support the latest versions of the game. I will sometimes support other versions until I no longer use them.

Q: Does this work on Spigot? Paper? (Insert other server software here)?

A: I only support Paper, but this will likely also work on forks of Paper (untested). There are no plans to support any other server software (i.e., Spigot or Folia).

## For Server Admins/Owners

## Why MIT?
I wanted a license that will keep my code open source while allowing as many people as possible to use this library if they so chose.
